For successful executing tests in IE 11 you should go "Свойства браузера" -> "Безопасность" -> uncheck "Включить защищенный режим" checkbox. Also you may need to set the same level of security for all the net zones and restart.

For execution tests in IDE you should write browser names in order of execution at Run -> Edit Configurations -> Program arguments.
